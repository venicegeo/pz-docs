# End-to-End Example

*TODO*

_complete script for end-to-end example of cropped-preview-generation demo_


The purpose of https://github.com/venicegeo/pzsvc-preview-generator[pzsvc-preview-generator] is to showcase Piazza's core capabilites.
This app exposes a REST endpoint which takes a POST request containing payload of required parameters. Given an s3 location, it downloads
a raster file, crops the image, uploads the cropped raster back up to S3 bucket, and returns a DataResource.


Post a request with a payload to the URL: https://pz-svcs-prevgen.stage.geointservices.io/crop

Sample working payload:

....
{
    "source": {
        "domain": "s3.amazonaws.com",
        "bucketName": "pz-svcs-prevgen",
        "fileName": "NASA-GDEM-10km-colorized.tif"
    },
    "function": "crop",
    "bounds": {
        "minx": -140.00,
        "miny": 10.00,
        "maxx": -60.00,
        "maxy": 70.00
    }
}
....

Service will download the file from "pz-svcs-prevgen" s3 bucket and crop it with given bounding box info. The cropped result tif will be uploaded back up to s3 bucket "pz-svcs-prevgen-output": https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1#&bucket=pz-svcs-prevgen-output&prefix=


If all goes well, the resulting received payload will be of DataResource type:

....
{
  "dataType": {
    "type": "raster",
    "location": {
      "type": "s3",
      "bucketName": "pz-svcs-prevgen",
      "fileName": "478788dc-ac85-4a85-a75c-cbb352620667-NASA-GDEM-10km-colorized.tif",
      "domainName": "s3.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "mimeType": "image/tiff"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "name": "External Crop Raster Service",
    "id": "478788dc-ac85-4a85-a75c-cbb352620667-NASA-GDEM-10km-colorized.tif",
    "description": "Service that takes payload containing S3 location and bounding box for some raster file, downloads, crops and uploads the crop back up to s3.",
    "url": "http://host:8086/crop",
    "method": "POST"
  }
}
....
